flight_fare_prediction_001

In this project I used the data which is available at the Kaggle and used it in machine learning to come up with a model which can predict the fare with minimum error.
I performed preprocessing of data such as Exproratory Data Ananysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Feature Engineering before applying the machine learning model.
This has helped me to gain insights from the data and understand in visual format how the various features are correlated. The random forest technique is one such regression tool which is used in this model. The train and text data has been split accordingly and tested for error.
