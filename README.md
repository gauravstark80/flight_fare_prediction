# flight_fare_prediction
flight_fare_prediction_001

In this project I used the data which is available at the Kaggle and used it in machine learning to come up with a model which can predict the fare with minimum error. I performed preprocessing of data such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Feature Engineering before applying the machine learning model. This has helped me to gain insights from the data and understand in visual format how the various features are correlated. The train and test data has been split accordingly. The random forest technique is one such regression tool which I used in this project and finally created a model. 

#Points
1. To create new environment so that we don't got with unnecessary libraries already present >>
conda create -n myenv python=3.7

2. Change directory uning                                  >>
cd dir_path

3. Open jupyter by going into working dir_path and type    >>
jupyter notebook

4. Before using command for requirements.txt do below:
#Create a new enviroment (best practice)                   >>
conda create -n myenv python=3.7

#activate environment (otherwise base environment remains) >>
activate myenv

6. To run app (flask ml web app)                           >>
python app.py

5. Use this in anaconda cmd for getting requirement.txt file with module and libraries name >>
pip freeze > requirements.txt 

6. To deactivate myenv                                     >>
conda deactivate myenv
